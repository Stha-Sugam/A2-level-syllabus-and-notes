- Data representation
    -> Built in Data Type: 

        > The data type that the programming language has already defined itself and the programmer can use these data types without declaring is built-in data types.
        > They are also called primary or primitive data types.
        > examples of these data types are: STRING, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, DATE, REAL, FLOAT,... etc.

    -> User Defined Data type : 

        Those data types that are defined by the user by deriving from the existing data type is known as user defined data type.
        examples of these data types are: array, class, module etc.
        
        1) Non-Compsite Data type:  The data type that are defined without the reference to other data type is known as non-composite data type. 
                                    It can also be built-in data types.
            i) Eneumerated Data type: Enumerated data type contains no references to other data types when it is defined. Enumerated data type has fixed values.
                > Structure for enumerated data type:
                    TYPE <identifier> = (value1, value2, value3, ... and so on) 
                > example of enumerated data type: 
                    TYPE Tmonth = (January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December)
                    Defining the months in pseudocode:
                    
                    DECLARE Thismonth : Tmonth
                    DECLARE Nextmonth : Tmonth
                    Thismonth <- January
                    Nextmonth <- Thismonth + 1

            ii) Pointer Data type: The Pointer data type is used to refrence a memory location.
                > Structure fot pointer data type:
                    Type <identifier> : ^<type name>
                    when the type is mentioned we have to give a caret (^) symbol to identify as a pointer.
                > example of pointer data type :
                    Type Phone_number_pointer : ^INTEGER 
                    
                    
        2) Composite Data type
            i)Sets
            ii) Classes

    -> File Organization and access:

        1) File Organization
            i) Serial file organization 
            ii) Sequential file orgnization 
            iii) Random file organization 

        2) file access
            i) Sequential access
            ii) Direct access

    -> Hashing Algorithm
