- Algebra
	-> 1.1 : The Modulus Function
		> (|x|) the modulus of x
		> Solving modulus equations 
		> Solving the simultaneous equations
			
			1.1 questions : solve equations/simultanesous equations with modulus
	
	-> 1.2 : Graphs of Modulus Functions
		> Graphs of y = |f(x)| where f(x) is linear
			-- the negative part will be directed to the posetive part in the graph.
		>  knowing how to sketch the modulus graph and 	solving the equations through the 	graph.
			
			1.2 questions : sketching graphs and finding the solutions for x (solving by graphical methods)
	
	-> 1.3 : Modulus Inequalities
		> solving modulus inequalities
		> inequalities such as (x-3)(x-5)<0 or (x-3)(x-5)>0 
			
			1.3 questions : solve equations with modulus and inequalities (by graphical or algebric method)
	
	-> 1.4 : Polynomial Division
		> Division of Polynomials
		> understanding the Polynomial division.
		> simplifying the equations by formula [P(x) = divisor/factor * quotient + remainder]
			
			1.4 questions : simplifying the polynomial equations and finding the remainder and quotient 

	-> 1.5 : The factor theorem 
		> understanding the concept of factor theorem
		> If the remainder is zero then the divisor is the factor for the polynomial.
		> using factor theorem to prove the factor of a polynomial 
		> If for a polynomial P(x), P(c) = 0 then (x-c) is the factor of the polynomial.
		> Solving polynomial equations: if the factors of the last digit gives result zero then that is the value of the given variable.
		
			1.5 questions : proving the factor, finding values of the given expressions, solving polynomial equations.

	-> 1.6 : The Remainder Theorem 
		> Understanding the concept of Remainder Theorem
		> If polynomial P(x) is divided by (x-a) the remainder is P(a)
		> When dividing the polynomial, if the remainder is q and divisor is x-a then [P(a) = q]

			1.6 questions : finding the remainder through remainder theorem, find the value of variables when factor and remainder when divided by divisor is given.

	Notes : 
		When finding the remainder and quotient by formula in the equation, the remainder should be [R, Rx + a, Rx^2 + a] according to the divisior in the question.
		The power in the remainder should be one less in the remainder than that of the divisior. eg : if the divisior is [x^2 + x + 1] then the remainder will be [Rx + a].  
		
- Logarithm and exponential functions
	
	We should know the concept of indices from before studies. Now we are gonna learn using logarithm instead of indices. 
	Know the concept of Logarithm and exponential.
	
	-> 2.1 : Logarithms to base 10  
		> Understanding the basic concept and using of logarithm/exponential function.
		> log to the base 10 is same as ln or lg.
		> Learning how to change the equation from Exponential to Logarithm and vice versa 
		> solving Logarithm and Exponential equations with only base 10.

			2.1 questions : Solving and changing Logarithm and Exponential equations.
	
	-> 2.2 : Logarithm to base a 
		> learning to solve logarithm and exponential equations with base other than base 10.(base 10 is the standered form of logarithm)
		
			2.2 questions : solving, converting and simplifying the logarithm and exponential equations, Finding the value of given variable.		
	
	-> 2.3 : The laws of logarithm
		> There are three laws of logarithm, we can use if the bases are same :
			i) multiplication law : eg: [log base a (x.y)] can be written as [log base a (x) + log base a (y)].
			ii) division law : eg: [log base a (x/y)] can be wirtten as [log base a (x) - log base a (y)].
			iii) power law : eg [log base a (x)^2] can be written as [2 x log base a (x)]
		
			2.3 questions : combining two or more than two logarithms to one single logarithm and simplifying the simple logarithm, expressing one variable in terms of other variables.
