- Algebra
	-> 1.1 : The Modulus Function
		> (|x|) the modulus of x
		> Solving modulus equations 
		> Solving the simultaneous equations
			
			1.1 questions : solve equations/simultanesous equations with modulus
	
	-> 1.2 : Graphs of Modulus Functions
		> Graphs of y = |f(x)| where f(x) is linear
			-- the negative part will be directed to the posetive part in the graph.
		>  knowing how to sketch the modulus graph and 	solving the equations through the 	graph.
			
			1.2 questions : sketching graphs and finding the solutions for x (solving by graphical methods)
	
	-> 1.3 : Modulus Inequalities
		> solving modulus inequalities
		> inequalities such as (x-3)(x-5)<0 or (x-3)(x-5)>0 
			
			1.3 questions : solve equations with modulus and inequalities (by graphical or algebric method)
	
	-> 1.4 : Polynomial Division
		> Division of Polynomials
		> understanding the Polynomial division.
		> simplifying the equations by formula [P(x) = divisor/factor * quotient + remainder]
			
			1.4 questions : simplifying the polynomial equations and finding the remainder and quotient 

	-> 1.5 : The factor theorem 
		> understanding the concept of factor theorem
		> If the remainder is zero then the divisor is the factor for the polynomial.
		> using factor theorem to prove the factor of a polynomial 
		> If for a polynomial P(x), P(c) = 0 then (x-c) is the factor of the polynomial.
		> Solving polynomial equations: if the factors of the last digit gives result zero then that is the value of the given variable.
		
			1.5 questions : proving the factor, finding values of the given expressions, solving polynomial equations.

	-> 1.6 : The Remainder Theorem 
		> Understanding the concept of Remainder Theorem
		> If polynomial P(x) is divided by (x-a) the remainder is P(a)
		> When dividing the polynomial, if the remainder is q and divisor is x-a then [P(a) = q]

			1.6 questions : finding the remainder through remainder theorem, find the value of variables when factor and remainder when divided by divisor is given.
